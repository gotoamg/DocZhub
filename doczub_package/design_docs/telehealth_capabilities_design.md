# Telehealth Capabilities Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for implementing comprehensive telehealth capabilities into DocZHub.com, inspired by Tebra's features. These capabilities will enable secure video visits, virtual waiting rooms, group appointments, and seamless integration with the existing appointment and EHR systems.
