# EHR Integration and HIPAA Compliance Framework Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for integrating Electronic Health Record (EHR) capabilities into DocZHub.com while ensuring HIPAA compliance across all features. The framework will serve as the foundation for implementing all Tebra-inspired features.

## EHR System Architecture

### 1. Data Model

  lab_results: JSON[]
  imaging_results: JSON[]
  created_at: Timestamp
  updated_at: Timestamp
}
```

#### Clinical Notes
```
ClinicalNote {
  id: UUID
  patient_id: UUID (foreign key to Patients table)
  provider_id: UUID (foreign key to Doctors table)
  appointment_id: UUID (foreign key to Appointments table)
  note_type: Enum (SOAP, Progress, Consultation, etc.)
  content: JSON (structured data for each section)
  status: Enum (Draft, Finalized)
  created_at: Timestamp
  updated_at: Timestamp
  finalized_at: Timestamp
}
```

#### Prescriptions
```
Prescription {
  id: UUID
  patient_id: UUID (foreign key to Patients table)
  provider_id: UUID (foreign key to Doctors table)
  medication_name: String
  dosage: String
  frequency: String
  duration: String
  quantity: Integer
  refills: Integer
  instructions: Text
  status: Enum (Active, Completed, Cancelled)
  created_at: Timestamp
  updated_at: Timestamp
}
```

#### Lab Orders
```
LabOrder {
  id: UUID
  patient_id: UUID (foreign key to Patients table)
  provider_id: UUID (foreign key to Doctors table)
  lab_tests: JSON[]
  status: Enum (Ordered, Completed, Cancelled)
  results: JSON
  ordered_at: Timestamp
  completed_at: Timestamp
}
```

### 2. API Endpoints

## HIPAA Compliance Framework

### 1. Data Security

#### Encryption
- Data at rest: AES-256 encryption for all PHI stored in the database
- Data in transit: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- End-to-end encryption for messaging and telehealth

#### Access Controls
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Multi-factor authentication for all provider accounts
- IP-based access restrictions
- Session timeout after period of inactivity
- Audit logging for all PHI access

#### Data Backup and Recovery
- Automated daily backups
- Encrypted backup storage
- Disaster recovery plan
- Regular recovery testing

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

#### User Authentication
- Strong password requirements
- Multi-factor authentication
- Biometric authentication option for mobile
- Session management with secure tokens

#### Authorization Framework
- Granular permission system
- Role-based access (Admin, Provider, Staff, Patient)
- Context-based permissions
- Temporary access delegation

### 3. Audit and Compliance

#### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive audit trails for all PHI access
- User activity monitoring
- Failed login attempts
- Data export and printing events
- System configuration changes

#### Compliance Reporting
- Automated HIPAA compliance reports
- Security incident tracking
- Breach notification workflow
- Regular compliance assessments

### 4. Patient Consent Management

#### Consent Framework
- Digital consent forms
- Consent versioning
- Consent withdrawal mechanism
- Consent audit trail

#### Data Sharing Controls
- Patient-controlled access to records
- Granular sharing permissions
- Temporary access grants
- Revocation mechanism

### 5. Secure Communication

#### Provider-Patient Messaging
- Encrypted messaging system
- Attachment security
- Message expiration
- Access controls

#### Telehealth Security
- Encrypted video streams
- Secure session establishment
- No recording by default
- Waiting room security
